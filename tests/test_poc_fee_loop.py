"""Regression tests for the fee/bounds config validation (2026-08-17 review,
F-4 - originally PoC B2).

Pre-fix, config.py put no upper bound on fee_percent_ppm (plain `int = 0`)
and nothing validated the bounds surface at startup: FEE_PERCENT_PPM >=
1_000_000 made _min_sendable_msat's walk non-terminating (fee >= amount at
every step, so the net can never clear min_mint_msat) - a single env var
turned every GET /p and LUD-16 alias into a permanent 100%-CPU hang (proven
live against a uvicorn subprocess during the review: those two endpoints
never answered, everything else did, each hanging sync handler pinning an
anyio threadpool worker forever). Sibling gaps: min_sendable >
max_sendable (every amount rejects), health_check interval 0 (busy-loops
getinfo against the node), negative base_fee.

The fix is startup validation (pydantic Field bounds + a model validator),
so a poisonous config fails AT BOOT with a clear ValidationError instead of
hanging the first request. These tests pin the bounds, plus the defensive
iteration cap in _min_sendable_msat itself (a settings object mutated
after construction, as tests do, bypasses pydantic - the cap turns the
hang into a loud error even then).
