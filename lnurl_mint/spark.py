"""The spark funding-source backend (https://github.com/breez/spark-sdk).

A third way to fund this mint besides lnd and cln: a spark wallet driven by
the Breez Spark SDK, via its Python bindings (`breez-sdk-spark`, an optional
dependency - install with `uv sync --extra spark`). The mint's whole
node.py contract is implemented on top of five SDK calls:

- create_invoice   -> receive_payment(BOLT11_INVOICE)   (the SSP issues it)
- pay_invoice      -> prepare_send_payment + send_payment (Lightning route)
- is_payment_complete / invoice_preimage / payment_preimage
                   -> list_payments (scanned by payment hash; a miss in
                      is_payment_complete is only believed after a forced
                      sync bracketed by two-leg remote probes)
- is_invoice_settled -> list_payments (same scan, receive side)
- sign_message     -> refused (see "LUD-25 offline verification" below)
- fetch_node_info  -> _remote_probe (coordinator + SSP) + get_info

Two deviations from the lnd/cln backends are load-bearing:

**create_invoice returns a None preimage.** lnd/cln let the caller supply
the preimage (r_preimage / preimage), so those backends return it and the
router derives payment_hash = sha256(preimage) - then discards the
preimage, per the spec's store-hashes-not-secrets policy. The spark SSP
instead generates and holds the preimage itself for an ordinary invoice
(a caller-supplied payment_hash makes it a *hodl* invoice, which only the
preimage holder can ever settle - and this mint deliberately does not
keep preimages). So the spark backend returns None and the router takes
the payment hash straight off the returned invoice. The preimage - for a
no-comment mint, the note's entire bearer secret - is then only ever
materialized live from the SDK's storage after settlement (see
_invoice_preimage_spark), exactly like lnd's LookupInvoice echo, and only
served through LUD-21 verify for comment-protected mints like there.

**LUD-25 offline verification is unavailable, not adapted.** The spec
fixes a note signature's digest as the "Lightning Signed Message"
construction - sha256(sha256(b"Lightning Signed Message:" + message)) -
which lnd's and cln's signmessage RPCs produce natively. The spark SDK's
sign_message signs ECDSA over plain single sha256(message) instead, with
no way to sign an arbitrary digest, and the wire response carries no
scheme field a wallet could use to tell the two apart - so a spark
signature would fail every spec-conformant verification. Rather than
advertise signatures no wallet accepts, _sign_message_spark raises and
signing.mint_pubkey/sign_note omit mintPubkey/sig for this backend
entirely (both optional per spec), same as when signing fails for lnd/
cln.

**The SDK is a process-wide singleton** built once (see _sdk), not a
per-call REST client like lnd/cln: it owns a sqlite store of its own (its
storage dir, see config.Settings.fundingsource_spark_storage_dir), background
sync/claim tasks on this process's event loop, and the seed-derived keys
of the mint's spark wallet. Building it per call would re-connect and
re-sync every time; instead every backend function here goes through
_sdk(config), which builds it lazily on first use and disconnects it at
shutdown (see shutdown, called from server.py's lifespan). The same
single-process rule as the mint's own db applies: never point two
processes at the same spark storage dir.

**A missing melt payment is never "not paid" - absence is indeterminate.**
lnd/cln persist their own payment record *before* any HTLC leaves the
node, so "no record" reliably means "nothing was sent". The spark SDK
persists its payment row only *after* the SSP has already accepted the
payment request, so a crash in exactly that gap leaves a live payment
with no local row - and answering False from that absence would let
router._melt_pay restore the note for a second melt into a *different*
invoice, which the idempotency key cannot deduplicate (it is derived from
the original invoice). Worse, the absence can't simply be synced away:
breez-sdk-spark 0.23's sync_wallet_internal catches and logs every
sub-sync failure yet still resolves Ok, and the reconciliation it
swallows spans two independently-operated services (the coordinator's
query_all_transfers and the SSP's transfer enrichment) - so no amount of
probing around a forced sync can *prove* the reconciliation itself
succeeded. is_payment_complete therefore answers False only from a
stored row the SDK itself reports FAILED, or from the same-process
prepare-rejection registry (_prepare_rejected: payments this process
turned away before send_payment was ever called - nothing was sent,
known first-hand). A missing row raises INDETERMINATE instead, after a
forced sync bracketed by the two-leg remote probe gives it every chance
to materialize (a networked attempt converges on a row answer; an outage
surfaces as the probe's own error). A melt that genuinely never happened
but whose rejection predates a restart stays pending for an operator to
resolve by hand - the same discipline the router already applies to any
melts whose outcome can't be established.

Amounts: the SDK's bolt11 surface is sat-denominated (u64) while this
mint is msat throughout. create_invoice requires a sat-aligned
amount_msat and rejects anything else with a clear error rather than
silently rounding; pay_invoice does the same for the melt side, where
the SDK would otherwise CEIL a fractional-sat invoice into whole sats
of spark leaves - debiting more than the note's value, and (since
splits can produce arbitrarily tiny fractional notes) over-draining
the wallet. Every other function converts the SDK's sat amounts back
to msat on the way out.

    coordinator's query_all_transfers (and that SSP failure is swallowed
    with the rest of the sync), so probing only the coordinator would
    miss a coordinator-up/SSP-down outage entirely; conversely the SSP
    leg is where a revoked Breez API key surfaces (the SSP wants the
    partner JWT, while operator RPCs authenticate with the wallet's own
    session) - the exact degradation the health check exists to notice.

    Verified against breez-sdk-spark 0.23 (see scripts/spark_mainnet_check.py's
    outage self-test): with endpoints unreachable, sync_wallet and get_info
    still resolve Ok - 0.23's sync_wallet_internal catches and logs every
    sub-sync failure - while both probe legs raise. Neither an Ok sync nor
    an Ok get_info is any evidence the network was reachable; this probe
    is what makes the health check in _fetch_node_info_spark real, and
    what gates is_payment_complete's "confirmed not paid" answer on
    connectivity that actually held."""

    """Whether an outgoing melt payment definitively completed or
    definitively failed - never a guess, which for this backend has a
    hard structural reason: the SDK persists a payment row only *after*
    the SSP has accepted the payment, so a crash in that gap leaves a
    live payment with no local row, and breez-sdk-spark 0.23's
    sync_wallet_internal swallows every reconciliation failure while
    still resolving Ok - meaning "no row, and a sync that claims success"
    can never *prove* the remote view lacks the transfer (the exact
    double-payout shape router._melt_pay guards against: a False here
    restores the bearer note for a second melt into a different
    invoice, which the idempotency key cannot deduplicate).

    So False is answerable from exactly two proofs, never from absence:
    a stored payment row the SDK itself reports as FAILED, or the
    same-process prepare-rejection registry (a payment this process
    rejected before send_payment was ever called - nothing was sent,
    known first-hand). Everything else raises: a pending row raises
    (not terminal), and a missing row raises INDETERMINATE - after first
    giving it every chance to materialize (a forced sync bracketed by
    the two-leg remote probe, so a networked attempt converges on a row
    answer quickly, and an outage surfaces as the probe's error rather
    than a bare "still nothing"). A note whose payment never happened
    and whose rejection predates a restart therefore stays pending for
    an operator - the spec's own resolution for unresolvable melts -
